                    <p class="card-text">I really did not know what to expect my first week of bootcamp at Awesome Inc and that is even after going through the intro to web development course. I really shouldn't have been surprised how fast we hit the ground running but I
                        think it is a good way to learn, no BS just get to it. I struggled with getting my git setup talking to github at first but felt really good once i figured the flow out. Such a powerful tool that I am learning to use excites me
                        at the possibilities! Added links on my blog to my projects and links pages and populated them with some content, while also touching up some css.

                    <p class="card-text">Pseudo Coding is a super useful practice that i have used in the past but I never knew there was a more standardized formatting. I struggled a bit to remember the new formatting we learned this week but still need to practice. I am
                        really excited to better convey my thoughts and ideas more clearly to others through the proper use of pseudo code format.

                    <p class="card-text">Had to do a lot of refreshing on my JavaScript skills this week. Spent way more time than I thought on the sum of all numbers from a to b than I thought since I had made one before in Java. I knew to use my Gauss formula which was
                        right sometimes but failed to remember to use the MATH.abs function with it to make sure it was always giving the correct output! lots of time banging my head until recalling to use the function.</p>

                    <h4 class="card-title">Pre-Work Fourth Week</h4>
                    <p class="card-text">Fourth week and staring at the beginning of the in person meat and potatoes part of the class starting next week. I am excited but also nervous about next week and the fact that my plan to dual boot my laptop with macOS on it failed
                        didn't help. I was able to put a virtual machine running Catalina but it was less than ideal. Finding a macbook air last minute definitely has alleviated a lot of that nervousness.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">This week's projects took some research to work through. Specifically learning about the Date() function, other functions like .getHours(). Checking my math on how to accurately calculate days, hours, minutes, and seconds from milliseconds.
                        The katas from this week really made me think and I wanted to try to solve them more efficiently and really think about my work flow. Specifically after I finished the array plus array kata I saw that there was a Concatenate function
                        that could have been used.
